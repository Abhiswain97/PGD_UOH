``\large y = mx + c``

The equation given is the equation for a straight line. 
- **m** -> slope
- **c** -> y-intercept
- **x** -> x-coordinate.

#### **Points to be noted**
1. Slope is same everywhere on a line
2. Two parellel lines have the same slope
3. Intersecting lines have different slopes

### General form of the equation of a straight line

`` \large ax + by + c = 0 ``

Rearranging to get it into the slope - intercept form gives:

`` \large y = \frac{-c-ax}{b} = \frac{-a}{b}x + \frac{-c}{b} ``

Here, m = `` \Large \frac{-a}{b} `` & `` c = \Large \frac{-c}{b} ``

If we generalize the equation to *n* dimensions

`` \large w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_0 = 0 ``

`` \large x_1, x_2, \dots ``

`` \large w_1, w_2, \dots ``

# Equation of a plane 

`` \large \pi : ax + by + cz + d = 0 ``

`` \large L: ax + by + c = 0 ``

`` \large \pi `` is used to represent plane 

We can also write it as a more general notation:

`` \large \pi : w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + w_0 = 0 ``


# Equation of a hyperplane

When the number of dimensions is greater than 2, then we call it **hyper-plane**
It is represented by: `` \large \pi_d ``

It's equation is:

`` \large \pi_d : w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \dots + w_dx_d + w_0= 0 ``
